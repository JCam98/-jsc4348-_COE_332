Description: This script constitutes the second of three scripts                                                                                                                                                                                                              
used for homework assignment #2. This program uses the I/O method "open()"                                                                                                                                                                                                    
to read in the contents of the JSON file "animals.JSON" to a JSON object.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The "random" module is then used to randomly choose one of the animal descriptions                                                                                                                                                                                            
to output to the console. The "random" module is used a second time to randomly                                                                                                                                                                                               
choose two of the animals in the generated list to breed, and the characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                             
of the parents, and offspring, are output to the console. This constitutes the
