        Homework #1: The Island of Dr. Moreau
        
Description: This script constitutes the first part of two scripts (the other 
being "read_animals.py") used for homework assignment #1. In this program, 
the "petname", and "random" modules are used to randomly generate a 20 element 
list of animals and their associated attributes (head type, body type, arm
number,leg number, and tail number) and assigns them each to a dictionary. In 
turn, these dictionaries are then appended to a list. The list of dictionaries
is then assigned to a one-element dictionary to create an exportable JSON 
object. This JSON object is then exported to a JSON file called "animals.json"
